# CS312_groupTSP_Genetic

The only change made to the ProblemAndSolver.cs aside from the Genetic method body was an added dependency on LINQ.  This is just at the very top of the file, and should be prety simple.

The other two files are helper classes that I wrote with the intent to make integration easier.
